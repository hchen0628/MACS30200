# Project Title
How does digital surveillance affect public political discussions on the Internet?

# Description/Abstract
This project investigates the impact of government surveillance and suppression on citizen dissent in the digital era, with a specific focus on Hong Kong during and after the enactment of the National Security Law. The chilling effect, a phenomenon where individuals restrict their behaviors due to perceived monitoring, plays a central role in our study. We analyze changes in online discourse using comprehensive data from LIHKG, Hong Kong's largest online forum, to capture real behaviors rather than solely relying on survey data which may not fully represent actual actions.

The 2019 Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong exemplifies digital activism, where social media was pivotal in organizing and spreading information. This movement, however, was significantly impacted by the imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, 2020, which aimed to address secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. This law led to a sharp decline in street protests and has posed new challenges for political expression and dissent.

Through this research, we aim to determine whether the legal and surveillance pressures exerted by the National Security Law have successfully suppressed online dissent as they have street protests, or if they have inadvertently fueled further public discontent, pushing expressions of dissent into the more anonymous corners of the internet.
